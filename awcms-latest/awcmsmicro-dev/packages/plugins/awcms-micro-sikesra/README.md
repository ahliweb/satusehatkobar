# AWCMS-Micro SIKESRA Plugin

This package is the AWCMS-Micro SIKESRA plugin for EmDash-compatible projects.

SIKESRA is a downstream AWCMS-Micro plugin for social, welfare, religious, institutional, document, verification, audit, import/export, RBAC/ABAC, typed frontend-backend-D1 integration, and public-safe aggregate workflows. It must remain isolated from EmDash core.

## Current Implementation Status

This package currently contains the SIKESRA plugin boundary, admin UI, routes, hooks, storage declarations, fixtures, and reference workflows. The production-grade implementation backlog is tracked through GitHub issues #119 through #143.

The plugin now uses the dedicated SIKESRA identity. New code should use `awcmsMicroSikesraPlugin`. The old `awcmsMicroExamplePlugin` export remains only as a temporary deprecated compatibility alias.

## GitHub Issue System

SIKESRA issues are execution contracts.

The issue standard is documented in:

```txt
docs/awcms-micro-github-issue-system.md
```

Diagram requirements are documented in:

```txt
docs/awcms-micro-mermaid-diagram-standard.md
awcmsmicro-dev/packages/plugins/awcms-micro-sikesra/docs/MERMAID_DIAGRAMS.md
```

Sequenced issue title pattern:

```txt
[SIKESRA][SEQ-XX][TYPE][PRIORITY] Title
```

Rules:

- `SEQ` controls execution order.
- `P0/P1/P2/P3` controls risk and urgency.
- Suffixes such as `SEQ-01A` or `SEQ-07A` insert urgent or dependency work without renumbering the whole backlog.
- Do not start later workflow issues before earlier identity, route, UI/UX, naming, guardrail, migration, repository, integration-contract, field-standard, RBAC/ABAC, and audit foundations are ready.
- Update SIKESRA Mermaid diagrams when an issue changes architecture, database/D1, UI/UX flow, frontend-backend integration, RBAC/ABAC, security, deployment, migration, or data preservation.

## Purpose

- keep SIKESRA-specific governance, registry, verification, access, audit, import/export, document, and ABAC behavior inside an isolated plugin boundary;
- provide an EmDash-compatible SIKESRA plugin without forking or modifying EmDash core;
- use dedicated SIKESRA data boundaries with `sikesra_` table and collection prefixes;
- support future production D1 tables and Cloudflare R2-compatible document metadata;
- integrate admin UI, API routes, service layer, repository layer, serializers, and D1 tables through typed contracts;
- preserve SIKESRA data across EmDash updates, dependency reinstalls, workspace rebuilds, local template rebuilds, and Cloudflare rebuilds.

- sandbox-compatible server-side entry in `src/sandbox.ts`.

## Core Governance Rules

### Plugin boundary

Keep plugin-owned behavior in this package. Do not move SIKESRA behavior into EmDash core packages.

### D1 table and collection prefix

All SIKESRA-owned D1 tables and plugin storage collections must use the `sikesra_` prefix.

Examples:

```txt
sikesra_registry_entities
sikesra_person_profiles
sikesra_supporting_documents
sikesra_verification_events
sikesra_audit_events
sikesra_user_role_assignments
sikesra_abac_policy_rules
sikesra_custom_attribute_definitions
sikesra_delete_requests
```

### Production data source

Dedicated D1 tables are the target production source of truth once the D1 migration issues are implemented. Plugin storage/KV may be used only as the current compatibility layer, migration source, or temporary fallback.

### Typed integration contract

Issue #143 defines the target integration flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as Admin UI
  participant Client as Typed API Client
  participant Route as Plugin Route
  participant Identity as Trusted EmDash User
  participant Guard as RBAC/ABAC Guard
  participant Service as Service Layer
  participant Repo as Repository
  participant D1 as sikesra_ D1 Tables
  participant Serializer as Serializer and Masking

  UI->>Client: Submit typed request
  Client->>Route: Call plugin API
  Route->>Identity: Resolve user
  Route->>Guard: Check permission and scope
  Guard->>Service: Allow validated operation
  Service->>Repo: Read or write model
  Repo->>D1: Query SIKESRA tables
  D1-->>Repo: Rows
  Repo-->>Service: Internal model
  Service->>Serializer: Prepare safe response
  Serializer-->>UI: Return masked UI response
```

### EmDash user identity

SIKESRA must reference trusted EmDash users. It must not create a duplicate user system and must not delete or mutate EmDash core user records.

SIKESRA-specific data belongs in SIKESRA tables:

```txt
sikesra_role_catalog
sikesra_permission_catalog
sikesra_user_role_assignments
sikesra_user_scope_assignments
sikesra_abac_policy_rules
```

### Field standards

All personal modules must distinguish KTP address and domicile address:

```txt
alamat_ktp_*
alamat_domisili_*
alamat_domisili_sama_dengan_ktp
```

KTP address and domicile address are sensitive personal data. Public routes must not expose them.

### Public aggregate

Public routes may expose only public-safe aggregate data. Personal, sensitive personal, restricted, raw document, and internal storage data must never be returned from public APIs.

### Lifecycle governance

Soft delete is the default. High-impact lifecycle actions must follow the governance workflow defined in issue #139.

### Update/rebuild safety

SIKESRA files, data, D1 tables, R2 metadata, EmDash user references, assignments, ABAC policies, audit events, import staging, custom attributes, and lifecycle governance data must survive EmDash update/rebuild workflows.

## Native And Sandbox Boundaries

- `src/index.ts`: trusted/native plugin entry used when the plugin needs React admin pages, widgets, and field widgets.
- `src/sandbox.ts`: server-side hooks and routes in the standard sandbox-compatible format.
- `src/admin.tsx`: native-only admin UI features.
- `src/runtime.ts`: storage, routes, hooks, manifest, and route wiring.
- `src/navigation.ts`: navigation model and EmDash adaptation.
- `src/permissions.ts`: permission constants and catalog surface.
- `src/contracts/`: target shared frontend-backend API contracts from #143.
- `src/admin/api/`: target typed admin API client from #143.
- `src/services/`: target service layer from #143.
- `src/serializers/`: target serializer and masking layer from #143.
- `src/db/`: target D1 repository layer from #122.

This separation keeps the server-side behavior portable while making native-only surfaces explicit.

## Safe Enablement

This plugin is intentionally not registered globally in EmDash core. Enable it from project-level configuration through the normal `plugins: []` configuration path.

Local template example after issue #140:

```ts
import { awcmsMicroSikesraPlugin } from "@awcms-micro/plugin-sikesra";

plugins: [awcmsMicroSikesraPlugin({ tenantId: "t-local-dev" })];
```

During the transition, the old `awcmsMicroExamplePlugin` alias may still exist but should not be used in new code.

## Standalone Usage

1. Copy this folder into its own repository or into a local packages directory in your project.
2. Run `pnpm install` in the plugin repository, or from the workspace root if you placed it inside a pnpm workspace.
3. Run `pnpm build` to produce the `dist/` output.
4. Review `emdash-plugin.jsonc` and ensure production SIKESRA metadata is set before publishing.
5. If you want repository or security metadata in the published manifest, add your own `repo` and `security` fields to `emdash-plugin.jsonc` before publishing.
6. Set `repository` and `homepage` metadata in `package.json` to match the real source location before publishing, including monorepo subdirectory metadata when applicable.
7. Reference the plugin from your EmDash project as a local package or publish it to your own registry.

## Access and ABAC Boundaries

The current access-rights and ABAC surfaces are plugin-owned. They must be integrated with trusted EmDash user identity according to issue #132 before being considered production-grade.

Rules:

- do not replace EmDash core authorization globally;
- enforce SIKESRA RBAC/ABAC inside SIKESRA routes;
- store SIKESRA role/scope/ABAC data in `sikesra_` tables;
- audit sensitive decisions;
- explicit deny wins.

## Testing

From this package directory:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

After issues #136, #137, and #143 are implemented, also run the SIKESRA guardrail and integration-contract scripts documented in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md`.
